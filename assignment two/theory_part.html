           <!-- QUESTION 1-->

<!-- List all primitive data types in javascript and give brief explanation of each-->


<!--A string which consists of characters having single or double quotes forexample,
"hello" or 'hello'-->

<!-- A number represents numerical values forexample integers like 1,2,3,4,
 and the float values like 2.4,6.5,6.8   -->

 <!-- Undefined data types represents a non_existent variable that
   is to say default variable -->

<!-- Null data type represents intentional absenceof an object
  value that is to say it is available without assigning a value-->

  <!-- Boolean data type represents a logical value that can either
    be true or false.-->

    <!-- BigInt data type represents a large integer that can 
     exceed a range of a number type.-->

     <!-- symbol data type represents a unique value that can 
      be used as a property key in objects-->


      <!-- QUESTION 2-->
       
<!--What is the difference between null and undefined data types in javascript-->


<!-- Null is a primitive value  that represents intentional absence of any object
  value if the assigning of an empty value to a variable .Null is an object type 
  that shows the existance of a variable with no value-->

<!-- While undefined data type is a primitive  value  that represents non_existent variable.
  different value of a variable that has not been assigned a value  -->


<!--QUESTION 3 -->

<!-- Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of javascript and thier
  values can not be changed once created forexample numbers, boolean, string
   which are known as immutable data. While reference data types are complex 
   data structures that store a reference to a valuerather than the actual
    valuethe variable holds the original value once its assigned the value.-->

<!-- QUESTION 4 -->

<!-- WHAT IS THE TYPE OF OPPERATORS  USED FOR ? PROVIDE TWO EXAMPLES-->

<!-- The typeOf opperator is used to determine the data type of a 
 values and variables in javascript.-->

<!--Example 1-->

<script> 

    let x = 5
    console.log(typeof x);
</script>

<!-- Example 2-->
